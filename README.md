## Building and Playing stuff
The top level makefile does the heavy lifting of building for you.  For a given project in `src` invokde `make build-PROJ` to build PROJ.  To play, do `make play-PROJ`.  You can set your emualtor of choice for the play option by adding `EMU=emulator` to the invocation.

## Credits
A lot of my learning has come from the work by [Damian Yerrick](https://github.com/pinobatch). This is still a work in progress, so I will be updating attribution as I go
